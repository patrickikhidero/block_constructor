###BLOCK CONSTRUCTOR
The challenge is open-ended and allows for multiple approaches.

##The problem

Bitcoin miners construct blocks by selecting a set of transactions from their mempool. Each transaction in the mempool:

includes a fee which is collected by the miner if that transaction is included in a block
has a weight, which indicates the size of the transaction
may have one or more parent transactions which are also in the mempool


The miner selects an ordered list of transactions that have a combined weight below the maximum block weight. Transactions with parent transactions in the mempool may be included in the list, but only if all of their parents appear before them in the list.

##How to test this code:
Make the csv file are in the same directory. 
You can use the following command to run the tests:
`python block_constructor.py`

This script will read from `bloc_list.csv`, construct blocks until there are no more transactions left in the mempool, then it will write the constructed blocks to the terminal
